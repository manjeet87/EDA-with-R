# White Wine Quality Analysis with-R
Here I have examined White Wine Quality data, in order out explore out the important factors in the white wine data, that can be correlated to the quality of the wine sample. The studies goes on with the analysis each of variable like sugar, citric acid, pH, slphur dioxide, alcohol content etc individually. 
Then i studied two variable at a time and tried to find the correlation with each other.
Lastly i studied multi variables simultaneously in order to find combined correlation.
I have used ggplot2 library in R for visualization of wine data. In all i have used following libraries:
1. ggplot2
2. dplyr
3. gridExtra
4. reshape2
5. tidyr
6. GGally

For visualisation, function used are ggplot, geom_histogram, geom_line, geom_point, geom_bar, geom_boxplot. Smoothening is done using geom_smooth.
